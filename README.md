Module 1 Homework
## Issues Experienced During Homework
I was a bit confused on when to stop using the Mac Terminal and start using Visual Studio Code's terminal. It was while creating the .gitignore file that I transitioned over.
## Outside Resources
- I rewatched the videos provides in Module 1. They were very helpful.  
- Also used the Git Cheat Sheet and Markdown Cheatsheet.
