Module 1 Homework
## Issues Experienced During Homework 
- I added the screen shot to my repo folder but the terminal said my working tree was clean and there was nothing to commit.
## Outside Resources
- I rewatched the videos provides in Module 1. They were very helpful.  
- Also used the Git Cheat Sheet and Markdown Cheatsheet.
